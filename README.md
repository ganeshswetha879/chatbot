# 🛡️ Guardian Bot – Your Neighborhood Emergency Companion

## 🚨 Overview

**Guardian Bot** is an AI-powered community safety assistant designed to help residents report, respond to, and recover from neighborhood emergencies. Whether it's a fire, flood, or a broken streetlight, Guardian Bot bridges the gap between **citizens**, **rescue teams**, and **community support systems**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Most neighborhoods lack a centralized platform where:
- Residents can **quickly report** local emergencies.
- Authorities and services can **verify and act fast**.
- Communities can **mobilize help** and **stay informed** in real time.

Delays in reporting or lack of awareness can result in **loss of life**, **property damage**, or **panic**.
